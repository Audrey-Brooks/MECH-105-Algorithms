# Linear Regression Function
linearRegression is a function that Computes the linear regression of a data set Computes the linear regression based on inputs.
Inputs:
1. x: x-values for our data set
2. y: y-values for our data set
Outputs:
1. fX: x-values with outliers removed
2. fY: y-values with outliers removed
3. slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
4. intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
5. Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination

# Example of call code: 
[fX, fY, slope, intercept, Rsquared] = linearRegression(x,y)
