# Special Matrix.
This is a functino that creates a matrix where the values of each element in the first row is the number of the column.
The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.
The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.
This was the fourth and final assignment created as review for my MECH 103 class the previous semester. 
# inputs:
n: number of rows in the matrix. m: number of columns in the matrix.
# outputs:
A: Matrix
# Example of Call Code
[A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
