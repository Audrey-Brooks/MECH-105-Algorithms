# Review problem
Algorithm creates two plots displayed in the same window of charge vs time for a specific function. The first plot displays the charge vs time of with a given capacitance and the second displays charge vs time with ten times the capacitance.

This assignment was created as a MATLAB review assignment from the previous semester's MECH 103 class.
